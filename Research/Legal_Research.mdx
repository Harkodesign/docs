## Overview of Copyright and AI-Generated Art

### Emerging Legal Landscape

- **AI in Art Creation:**
AI-generated art involves sophisticated algorithms that display cognition-like processes, creating provocative works of art that challenge traditional views of authorship and ownership​​.

- **Defining AI-Generated Art:**
The definition of AI-generated art involves computational systems exhibiting creative behavior, using machine learning to develop algorithms for generating novel and unexpected outputs​​.

## Summaries of Significant Copyright Cases

### Case 1: Jason M. Allen's AI Artwork
- **Summary:** Jason M. Allen used generative AI software to create "Théâtre D’opéra Spatial," winning part of the Colorado State Fair’s art contest. However, the U.S. Copyright Office ruled that the work could not be copyrighted as Allen was not deemed the "author" of the piece​​.
- **Relevance:** This case highlights the complex issue of defining authorship in AI-generated art, as the office determined that Allen's contribution was limited to inputting a text prompt and making subsequent visual modifications​​.

### Case 2: The 'Monkey Selfie' Case
- **Summary:** This case involved a dispute over a selfie taken by a monkey, raising questions about non-human authorship. Although not directly related to AI, the case is significant for its implications on authorship by non-human entities​​.
- **Relevance:** This case serves as a precedent in the broader discussion of authorship in AI-generated content, reinforcing the notion that copyright law is intended to protect human authors​​.
